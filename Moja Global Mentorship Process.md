# Moja Global Mentorship Process

This document contains information on the mentorship process of Moja
global for GSoC, GSoD, Outreachy, and LFX.

## Setting Project Milestones

Project milestones should be achievable and set based on the duration of
the internship program the mentor would be participating in.
-    **GSoc- 12 weeks(extendable)**
-    **GSoD- 10 to 12 weeks**
-    **Outreachy- 12 weeks**
-    **LFX- 12 weeks**

With the duration of the internship in mind, you can create a suitable
milestone for your project as follows;

-   Step 1: Create a project goal: A project objective shows you how you'll be able to accomplish the goal.
-   Step 2: Structure your project into tasks and subtasks: The best project approach method is splitting your entire project into tasks and subtasks.
-   Step 3: Assigning the milestones: Arrange your tasks and group them according to different project phases.
-   Step 4: Using Gantt Chart To Clearly Map The Milestones: A Gantt chart is a method in which to create a visualization of your entire project timeline.

## Project Proposals

Project proposals vary for the different internship programs.

-   GSoC project proposals are submitted by contributors for selection by Moja global GSoC mentors. A list of project proposals for each season can always be found on the [GSoC Mentor dashboard](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/moja-global/programs).

-   GSoD project proposals are submitted by the Moja global organization and you can follow [Creating the organization proposal](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/org-proposal-template) to create a project proposal for GSoD.

-   Outreachy mentors can submit a project proposal by following the [Call for Outreachy mentors](https://www.outreachy.org/communities/cfp/moja-global/) panel on their dashboard.

-   In LFX, a mentor creates tasks and assigns them to interested mentees. Mentors can [create a profile](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship) and submit project proposals for each program schedule.

## Asking for Help

Generally, Moja global has a communication room for each mentorship program on the [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw). However, these channels are used to orientate and guide aspiring interns. The following links would help you clarify doubts about each
program.

## Holding Candidate selection Panel with Co-mentors

During the selection process, it is advisable to hold a candidate selection panel by creating a private room on the [communication channel](https://join.slack.com/t/mojaglobal/shared_invite/zt-o6ta1ug0-rVLjAo460~d7JbZ~HpFFtw). This room should be limited to you, the Organization coordinator, and your co-mentors. The following tips are helpful during the application and selection process.

### Too Many Applicants?

Because we ask the applicants to collaborate with mentors during the application process, mentors often find themselves overwhelmed with potential applicants. Please do not hesitate to redirect applicants to other projects or to learn more on their own if one of the following applies:

-   You already have one or two strong applicants working with you,
-   You already have as many applicants as you can possibly work with during the application process.
-   The applicant clearly lacks the basic skills needed for succeeding in your project. Please point them to the relevant resources that can help them learn more first.

### Too Few Applicants?

Some of the common causes for too few applicants are:

-   The project description does not define what the project is in layman terms.
-   No clearly defined starter tasks.
-   Unresponsive mentor.
-   Not enough project advertisement

### Avoiding Biased Intern Selections

Mentors should not have a particular applicant in mind when they submit their project description. Mentors should work with all applicants and pick the applicant that has the strongest contribution during the contribution period. To eliminate bias in picking interns, Mentors can abide by the following rules:

-   Do not pick an applicant because you have a prior relationship with them
-   Do not pick an applicant on the basis of the country they are living in
-   Do not pick an applicant because they work in your city
-   Do not pick an applicant because of their education level

## Mentor Feedback

Understanding how feedback works during the learning process can help you make informed decisions about how to provide the right kind of feedback for your interns.

A mentor has the distinct responsibility to nurture an intern's learning and to provide feedback in such a manner that the intern does not leave the program feeling defeated. Here you will find ideas and techniques on how to give positive learning feedback that will leave your interns with the feeling they can conquer the world.

- Feedback should be educative in nature. 
>Providing feedback means giving interns an explanation of what they are doing correctly *and* incorrectly. However, the focus of the feedback should be based essentially on what the intern is doing right. It is most productive to an intern's learning when they are provided with an explanation and example as to what is accurate and inaccurate about their work.

Consider using the concept of a 'feedback sandwich' to guide your feedback: Compliment, Correct, Compliment.

- Feedback should be given in a timely manner. 
>When feedback is given immediately after showing proof of learning, the intern responds positively and remembers the experience of what is being learned in a confident manner. If we wait too long to give feedback, the moment is lost and the intern might not connect the feedback with the action.

- Be sensitive to the individual needs of the intern.
>Some interns need to be nudged to achieve at a higher level and others need to be handled very gently so as not to discourage learning and damage self-esteem. A balance between not wanting to hurt an intern's feelings and providing proper encouragement is essential.

- Ask the 4 questions.
>Providing answers to the following four questions on a regular basis will help provide quality feedback.
What can the intern do?
What can't the intern do?
How does the intern's work compare with that of past interns?
How can the intern do better?

- Give feedback to keep interns 'on target' for achievement.
>Regular 'check-ins' with interns let them know where they stand in the
project timeline and with you.

Host a one-on-one conference.

>Providing a one-on-one meeting with an intern is one of the most effective means of providing feedback. The intern will look forward to having the attention and allowing the opportunity to ask necessary questions.

- Concentrate on one ability or skill. 
>It makes a far greater impact on the intern when only one skill is critiqued versus the entire task being the focus of everything that is wrong.

- Invite interns to give you feedback.
>Make it so that interns can give you feedback. What did they like about your approach? What didn't they like? If they were mentoring, what would they do differently? What did they learn the most from you as a mentor?

Remember that feedback goes both ways and as mentors, it is wise to never stop improving and honing your skills.
