## Global analysis of forests 

The task is to pick a favourite forest, make analysis and report my findings which I have done [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Hafsah2020/Outreachy_Hafsah_Anibaba_2022/blob/main/global_forest_analysis.ipynb#AgroEcological-zones-of-forest)

### Administrative boundaries

To see the avilable forests I plotted all forests from the data I got [here](https://datasets.mojaglobal.workers.dev/0:/Bioclimatic&EcologicalZones/HoldridgeLifeZones.json) and I have this
![forests in the world](Images/forests_in_the_world.JPG)

Then I picked interest in `tropical dry forests` and focused analysis on this type of forest
The locaton and boundaries of tropical dry forests is shown here:

### Bioclimatic zones

###### Agro-ecological zones

I plotted the forest against their agroecological zones here:
![Agro ecological zones](Images/agro_eco_zones.png)

The forests are mostly found in the subhumid soils and moist soils agro-ecological zones

###### Biomes

I plotted the forest against their Biomes here:
![Agro ecological zones](Images/biomes.png)

The forests are mostly found in the Tropical and subtropical moist broadleafs, savannah and shrublands,

###### Water scarcity zones

I plotted the forest against water scarcity zones here:
![Water scarcity zones](Images/fav_forest_nut_water.png)

The forests are located mostly in the economic water scarcity zones and alos in the physical water scarcity zones


###### Soil nutrients

I plotted the forest against soil nutrients here:
![Soil nutrients zones](Images/soil_nutrients.png)

The forests are located ????


###### Dominant soil cover

I plotted the forest aginst tyheir agroecological zones here:
![Water scarcity zones](Images/dominant_cover.png)

The forests are located ???


### Climate
I plotted to see the climates of tropical dry forsts
![climate](Images/climate.png)

As expected they are found in tropical dry forests


### Soil resources

I plotted to see the kind of soils in tropical dry forsts
![Soil resources](Images/soil.png)

The soil resources commonly found in tropical dry forests are Vertisol,  Lixisol
